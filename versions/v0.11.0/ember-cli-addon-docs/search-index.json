This is especially useful in Ember.Component-architecture but can be used across all layers of your application - e.g. when implementing global application state backed by an Ember.Service that needs to switch your application into a specifc mode based on data that your application receives via push events. By using statecharts you can improve your development workflow in multiple ways: Model behavior explicitly. Instead of relying on implicit states that you manage by setting properties on your objects you will model your behavior as a set of explicit states that handle events. Create robust applications that won't break. Because behavior is only executed when a given state understands an event that is being triggered it is impossible to trigger invalid or unexpected application behavior. Refactor and refine with confidence. Application flows modeled with statecharts are easy to change without the risk of breaking existing behavior. Document behavior. Because statecharts can be visualized you finally have a way of communicating about application behavior with stakeholders that don't have a programming background. It will also help fellow developers to reason about behavior in your application. Identify missing requirements. Because you make use of a visual language that describes behavior it gets very easy to identify holes in requirement documents.

Even with an ambitious framework like Ember.js client-side application development can get very complex and there are several reasons for this being the case: client-side apps are stateful - client side apps are a system that allows users to request data from someplace and manipulate it entirely on the user's client device. Application developers' job is to manage the ui-state created by the user interacting with the requested data in their applications and make sure to always display the correct representation of that state to their users. We are building complex reactive systems because the representation of client-side state has to react continiously to internal and external events: Internal events - events triggered by the user like clicks, text input etc. External events - events triggered by the outside like server responses, web-socket push-events or timers firing. Modeling this behavior is very complex if not done explicitly. The usual way to develop client-side applications though is implicit. Developers usually develop code in an ad-hoc fashion by setting properties based on actions on components and other objects that can hold state. This implicit modeling breaks down fast even for medium level complexity. Components that implement their behavior implicitly are hard to reason about, hard to maintain and hard to extend. [Horrocks 99] Discussing behavior is very difficult with other stakeholders. There's no shared language between developers, designers and other stakeholders like product-owners. Thus a lot of requirements are left unidentified in the requirements phase of a development iteration - loading-states are often forgotten and nobody on the team really can answer questions about how the application should behave when certain events have happened in the application lifecylce - \"What happens when the the user loses the server connection during upload?\" and similiar are questions that come up during development but not before. This leads to frustration on teams and missed deadlines because so much of the implicit requirements have not been accounted for during planing phase. Statecharts to the rescue A way to deal with the difficulties of client-side application development is to use statecharts to model your application's behaviors explicitly: The behavior of a reactive system is really the set of allowed sequences of input and output events, conditions, and actions, perhaps with some additional information such as timing constraints. – David Harel, Statecharts: a visual formalism for complex systems The literature has been conclusive in that dynamic complex behavior is best modeled as a set of states that react to events - statecharts are a way of modeling behavior explicitly in a scalable way even for the most complex behaviors. [Harel 87] Statecharts can be modeled explicitly and are executable. Instead of relying on implicit state management you model behavior as a executable statechart configuration that makes it is impossible for your application to behave in an unexpected way. With Statecharts it is easy to understand and change existing behavior. Statecharts are easy to reason about, refine and maintain because states in statecharts can be extended and nested. In addition to explicitly modeling behavior statecharts can be used to visualize modeled behavior and can thus be used to close a gap in client-side-application development today where it is hard to discuss application behavior with other stakeholders of the application. Statecharts can be used as an easy to understand shared language between stakeholders - designers, product-owners and developers. statecharts can be used as a modeling tool in the requirements phase, as an implementation tool in the coding phase and as a debugging and documentation tool in the production phase of your application. Documenting behavior Modeling your application behavior explicitly via ember-statecharts will give you documenation of your application behavior for free. Statecharts can be visualized via the statechart-editor and you will have an easier time to understand components and user-flows by looking at them. Visalizing statecharts also gives you the opportunity to communicate about behavior with other stakeholders - designers, product-owners and fellow developers. Because you are modeling behavior explicitly with an executable statechart in your code there is now always up-to-date documentation of how components and other parts of your app behave. You can step through your behavior with the statechart-editor and have discussions about how your application behaves based on a visual language that everyone understands. Powered by xstate ember-statecharts provides a small Ember.js specific wrapper around the fabulous and widely-used xstate-library. All of the powerful features of xstate are supported. The purpose of ember-statecharts is to make it easy to use xstate in an Ember.js application without having to write the same boilerplate code over and over again. ember-statecharts vs. ember-concurrency ember-statecharts is not a contender to ember-concurrency. Both addons can be used in combination. ember-concurrency gives you a clean api to handle async interactions in your code and will handle cleanup when components are destroyed. After modeling the states in your components explicitly for some time you might even come to the conclusion that the reason why ember-concurrency is so great is that it models async interactions explicitly. But async interactions with apis are not the only complex reactive behavior you will want to model in your applications explicitly. If you want to model a complex sign-up flow for example it might include async interaction with your backend api but you will still want to model the rest of the sign-up flow explicitly and ember-statecharts will help you with that. You can see examples of how to use ember-concurrency and ember-statecharts in combination in the tutorial. References [Harel 87] D.

The xstate-guides provide extensive documentation about how to write statechart-configurations - please make use of this invaluable resource. ember-statecharts is trying to provide a thin layer over xstate's apis and make it as easy as possible to use all of xstate's functionality with Ember.js. It makes sure your statecharts play nice with the Ember-runloop, will wait for xstate-delays etc. when testing your applications and takes care of cleaning up your statecharts when components get destroyed. Authoring statechart-configurations To implement a statechart via ember-statecharts you will make use of the useMachine- usable exported from ember-statecharts. usable support has yet to land in the framework so you will need to make use of ember-usable for now to use the @use-decorator - ember-usable will be installed for you when you install ember-statecharts. There are three ways to create a statechart with useMachine: use useMachine with an instance of an xstate-Machine - Machine use useMachine with a valid MachineConfig - MachineConfig use useMachine by using xstate's - createMachine - createMachine; Here's an example that reflects the nested statechart-example from the xstate-guides in all three variants: useMachine with a Machine-instance import Component from '@glimmer/component'; import { Machine } from 'xstate'; import { use } from 'ember-usable'; import { useMachine } from 'ember-statecharts'; const machine = Machine({ id: 'light', initial: 'green', states: { green: { on: { TIMER: 'yellow' } }, yellow: { on: { TIMER: 'red' } }, red: { on: { TIMER: 'green' }, initial: 'walk', states: { walk: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'wait' } }, wait: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'stop' } }, stop: {} } } } }); export default class MyComponent extends Component { @use statechart = useMachine(machine) } useMachine with a MachineConfig import Component from '@glimmer/component'; import { use } from 'ember-usable'; import { useMachine } from 'ember-statecharts'; export default class MyComponent extends Component { @use statechart = useMachine({ id: 'light', initial: 'green', states: { green: { on: { TIMER: 'yellow' } }, yellow: { on: { TIMER: 'red' } }, red: { on: { TIMER: 'green' }, initial: 'walk', states: { walk: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'wait' } }, wait: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'stop' } }, stop: {} } } } }) } useMachine with createMachine import Component from '@glimmer/component'; import { createMachine } from 'xstate'; import { use } from 'ember-usable'; import { useMachine } from 'ember-statecharts'; export default class MyComponent extends Component { @use statechart = createMachine({ id: 'light', initial: 'green', states: { green: { on: { TIMER: 'yellow' } }, yellow: { on: { TIMER: 'red' } }, red: { on: { TIMER: 'green' }, initial: 'walk', states: { walk: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'wait' } }, wait: { on: { PED_TIMER: 'stop' } }, stop: {} } } } }) } To get a detailed overview about the configuration options available via xstate please have a look at the xstate documentation. Sending events When implementing behavior with statecharts you have to switch your mental model a bit when implementing Ember.js application behavior. The important thing is that you won't trigger behavior directly based on user-interaction or external events anymore - you will forward the event that happened to your statechart and let the statechart figure out what will happen based on the event that you forwarded. This means that you will want to change actions like this: export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... @action buttonClicked() { this.buttonClickedTask.perform(); } } to something like the following: import { Machine } from 'xstate'; const buttonMachine = Machine( { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { onEntry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { RESOLVE: 'success', REJECT: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit(/* context, event */) {} } } ); export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... @use statechart = useMachine(buttonMachine) .withContext({ component: this }) .withConfig({ handleSubmit(context) { const { component } = context; component.buttonClickedTask.perform(); } }) // ... @action buttonClicked() { this.statechart.send('SUBMIT'); } }; This might seem like an annoying level of indirection first but soon you will notice that this indirection provides a safety net for your application behavior. Instead of the burden of keeping track of the implicit states that your application can find itself in in your head all the time you will model your behavior explicitly and let the statechart figure out what needs to happen. In the above example users can't retrigger the buttonClickedTask when they trigger the buttonClicked repeatetly while the statechart finds itself in the busy state for example. The statechart's context - using withContext The Object that @uses the useMachine-usable will need to specify the context of the statechart explicitly by using withContext. This makes sure that you can design your behavior inside of xstate's visualizer completely and then have the calling Object define what it considers the context of the statechart to be. This means you have the component decide what context will be used when guards and actions are executed. import { Machine } from 'xstate'; const buttonMachine = Machine({ initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { onEntry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { RESOLVE: 'success', REJECT: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit(context) { // `context` is set to whatever object we pass to `withContext` const { component } = context; context.buttonClickedTask.perform(); } } }); export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... @use statechart = useMachine(buttonMachine) .withContext({ component: this }) @task(function*() { // ... }) buttonClickedTask; @action buttonClicked() { this.statechart.send('SUBMIT'); } } Customizing the statechart's config - using withConfig As with withContext the calling Object can also customize the statechart's configuration by using withConfig. This makes sure that you can design your behavior inside of xstate's visualizer completely and then have the calling Object define what external effects will be triggered when the statechart triggers actions or what checks to run when it executes guards. import { Machine } from 'xstate'; const submitMachine = Machine({ initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: { target: 'busy', cond: 'allNecessaryDataIsAvailable' } } }, busy: { onEntry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { RESOLVE: 'success', REJECT: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit(/* context, eventObject */) {} }, guards: { allNecessaryDataIsAvailable(/* context, eventObject */) {} } }); export default class MyComponent extends Component { @tracked name = ''; @tracked password = ''; @use statechart = useMachine(submitMachine) .withContext({ component: this }) .withConfig({ actions: { handleSubmit({ component }, eventObject) { const { email, password } = eventObject; component.loginTask.perform(email, password); } }, guards: { allNecessaryDataIsAvailable({ component }, eventObject) { const { email, password } = component; return email && password; } } }); // ... @action buttonClicked() { this.statechart.send('SUBMIT'); } } Including event data When sending an event to your statechart you can send data with that event. The sent data will be available in guards and actions that are executed based on the sent event: import { Machine } from 'xstate'; const submitMachine = Machine({ initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: { target: 'busy', cond: 'allNecessaryDataIsAvailable' } } }, busy: { onEntry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { RESOLVE: 'success', REJECT: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit(/* context, eventObject */) {} }, guards: { allNecessaryDataIsAvailable(/* context, eventObject */) {} } }); export default class MyComponent extends Component { @use statechart = useMachine(submitMachine) .withContext({ component: this }) .withConfig({ actions: { handleSubmit({ component }, eventObject) { const { email, password } = eventObject; component.loginTask.perform(email, password); } }, guards: { allNecessaryDataIsAvailable(context, eventObject) { const { email, password } = eventObject; return email && password; } } }); // ... @action buttonClicked() { const { email, password } = this; this.statechart.send('SUBMIT', { email, password }); } } Matching state You can declaratively react to state changes in your statechart by making use of the matchesState-decorator. This means that when you want to for example display a button component differently based on the state it finds itself in this is very easy to do with ember-statecharts: import { use } from 'ember-usable'; import { matchesState, useMachine} from 'ember-statecharts'; export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... @use statechart = useMachine({ initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { onEntry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { RESOLVE: 'success', REJECT: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }); @matchesState('error', 'statechart') didError; } <button class={{if this.didError \"btn btn__error\" \"btn\"}}> Click me </button> You can pass a StateValue or an array of StateValues to matchesState. This means you can also match against nested or parallel states: // atomic state node @matchesState('idle', 'statechart') // nested state @matchesState({ error: 'apiError' }, 'statechart') // parallel state @matchesState({ validity: 'invalid', interaction: { changed: 'fieldBlurred' } }, 'statechart') // the second param to `matchesState` is optional when the statechart property // is called `statechart` @matchesState('idle') .update - Reacting to changes to useMachine When args or state passed to useMachine, withConfig or withContext change users are able to react to the change without needing to use @ember/render-modifiers or ember-render-helpers to send an event to the statechart. To demonstrate this behavior we'll create a CounterMachine that implements counting behavior. The component that uses it will be passed a count-arg. Whenever this arg changes we want to react to the change: We can react to the change in two ways. 1) We send an event to the statechart on update and the statechart reacts to the change as it would to any other external or internal event - in our case this means we reset context.count to the count-arg we receive in the update: Update Counter-Count 2) We restart the entire underlying xstate-interpreter and end up with a statechart as if we accessed if for the first time with the update machine, context or config. In our case this means that we will end up in the inactive-state again even if we were in the active state before. Update Counter-Count How you choose handle an update to args/state passed to useMachine - either sending an event or restarting the interpreter - depends on the situation you find yourself in. If your situation allows throwing away the current state of the statechart restarting could be an option to consider. If you need to consider the current state when args change you will most likely find it easier to send an event to the statechart instead of restarting the entire interpreter. Legacy api ember-statecharts still ships with the legacy computed-macro api. If you want to see the documentation about how to use this api please refer to the 0.9.x-version of this docs page. Visualizing statecharts To visualize your statecharts you can use the xstate visualizer. Further reading xstate comes with a comprehensive documentation page - it goes into great detail about what things you can do in statechecart-configurations. Writing statecharts configurations is very easy once you are used to the syntax but feel free to consult the xstate-guides as often as necessary to get the hang of it.","route":"docs.statecharts","keywords":[]},"template:docs/tutorial":{"id":"template:docs/tutorial","type":"template","title":"Tutorial","text":"Tutorial You can install ember-statecharts like any other ember addon: ember install ember-statecharts A button component To help you getting started with ember-statecharts we will walk through an example of implementing a button component. Requirements Our button should indicate to users their ability to interact with them - i.e. a button can be enabled or disabled and looks differently based on these states. The button should be able to trigger actions based on the onClick-property passed to it. When the executed action takes time the button should indicate this to users We want application developers to be able to react to the success of the triggered action We want application developers to be able to react to errors of the triggered action Modeling behavior We will model our behavior visually by putting our button statechart configuration into xState's visualizer tool. We start by creating an idle and busy-state - because the button can either sit around idle ready to be clicked or be busy while the onClick-action we pass to it is executing. { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: {}, busy: {} } } When the user clicks the button we want to transition from the idle-state to the busy-state. Statechart transitions happen based on events sent to the statechart. We will model our statechart to transition based on the SUBMIT-event. { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: {} } } You can interact with the statechart during the modeling phase. You will see the statechart transitionig into the busy state when clicking on the submit event in the statechart-editor. Triggering actions Transitioning between states is not enough for our statechart to actually do something. To have our statechart 'do' something we can implement actions that we will tell the statechart to execute on state-transitions. You can trigger actions at specific points of a transition: entry - when a state is entered exit - when a state is exited on a transition - when you want to trigger actions only on a specific transition To model the behavior of our button component we decide to trigger the handleSubmit-action every time we enter the busy state. The button will be in the busy state and we can then decide where to transition afterwards based on the outcome of the triggered action. This leads us to the conclusion that we actually are missing a state. There's nowhere to transition to after busy. We seem to are missing a success state. { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { entry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { SUCCESS: 'success' } }, success: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit() {} } } But what happens if the potentially async onClick fails? We need an error state as well. This is one of the advantages of using ember-statecharts to model behavior. Because you are modeling behavior explicitly you need to think about what can happen in your application before actually implementing something. This will lead you to really think about the use-case you are trying to implement and it gets very easy to add states if you discover you missed something: { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { entry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error' } }, success: {}, error: {} } }, { actions: { handleSubmit() {} } } Ok now we can now transition into error and success but we want developers to be able to handle these events so we will need to trigger behavior when each of those states is entered. This is easy to do - we add a new actions entry for both states: { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { entry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error' } }, success: { entry: ['handleSuccess'] }, error: { entry: ['handleError'] } } }, { actions: { handleSubmit() {}, handleSuccess() {}, handleError() {} } } This looks pretty good - let's have a quick look at the statechart-editor again. When clicking through the editor we notice that our statechart behaves in kind of a weird way. We can transition trough to success and error but there's no way to exit those two states again. This might be good enough in your application but most likely this indicates a problem. When dealing with a generic button component it seems like we should be able to submit the button again after we successfully submitted the button or the action triggered by the button failed. This is something that is easily missed when not using a statechart to visualize the behavior of your components. If you did not use a statechart you would be setting conditional properties like isLoading on the button component directly and you might have some kind of condition in your code that makes sure that your button can not be submitted while its isLoading property is true. You then would need to make sure to reset that property onError or onSuccess - but this is easy to forget, very error prone and hard to reason about. In contrast to working with implicit behavior with ember-statecharts we simply add a new transition to both states: { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, busy: { entry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error' } }, success: { entry: ['handleSuccess'], on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } }, error: { entry: ['handleError'], on: { SUBMIT: 'busy' } } } }, { actions: { handleSubmit() {}, handleSuccess() {}, handleError() {} } } Executing the modeled statechart Modeling the statechart for our button component is complete now. But how do we actually use this in our Ember.js application? It's pretty easy actually. We take the statechart (xstate calls them Machines) we modeled in the statechart-editor, create an instance of it and use it in our component via the useMachine-usable that ember-statecharts provides. In our example application we decided to create a machines-folder that holds all the xstate-machines that we plan to use in our components. We can copy and paste these out of the statechart-editor directly and paste them back into the editor when we want to see how they work. We then have to hook up the imported machine with our component. We can use the withContext- and withConfig-hooks that are available when using useMachine. The nice thing about this is that we keep the behavior separate from our component implementation. The component that decides to use the statechart defines what it expects to happen as external effects when the statechart executes its behavior - we use the withConfig- hook to do this. In our case we tell the statechart to trigger the performSubmitTask-function and what should happen when the async action triggered succeeds or errors. Because we define these functions on the statechart itself we need to bind them to the component instance - we do this by using the @action-decorator that Ember provides in our example. If we didn't want to use @action we could use Function.prototype.bind to achieve the same effect. You can see the final component in action here: To trigger transitions on the statechart we implement regular Ember Component actions that forward events to our component. If the user clicks the button we will send the SUBMIT action to our statechart and the statechart will trigger a transition into the appropriate state. If no transition is specified in the statechart for the sent event nothing happens - it has literally become impossible to trigger unexpected behavior. // ... export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... @action buttonClicked() { this.statechart.send('SUBMIT'); } } If a states doesn't understand an event nothing happens. You can see this while the submit-task is performed. If the user clicks the button repeatedly nothing happens. Because the busy-state does not handle the SUBMIT-event it won't trigger the submitTask again. When we want to keep the UI in sync with the statechart's state we can do this by using the matchesState-decorator. // ... export default class MyComponent extends Component { // ... // the second param is optional if the statechart is called `statechart` @matchesState('busy', 'statechart') isBusy; @use statechart = useMachine({ // ... }) // ... } The matchesState-decorator will be true if the passed state matches the statechart's current state. You can match against a singular state, an array of states and even match against nested and parallel states with this decorator - please refer to the working with statecharts-section for details. Refining behavior We implemented the expected submit behavior but we can't set the button in a disabled state. This isn't too surprising we have yet to model the disabled behavior. The disabled-state is somewhat of an odd state because it concerns how the button looks (e.g. a disabled button might show as greyed out) and how the button behaves (clicking the button won't trigger its onClick-action). Statecharts are used to model behavior so we don't want to concern ourselves with the looks of the button for now - we will get to that later. But first of all we need to figure out how disabling the button fits into our statechart. If we think about it the way the button handles clicks and the fact if the button should be interactive are really two concurrent things. We could for example decide to disable the button while the button is in the busy-state. Disabling the interactivity of the button should most likely not cancel the submit-action. We can model two concurrent behaviors - interactivity and activity in our example - with a parallel state: { type: 'parallel', states: { interactivity: { initial: 'unknown', states: { unknown: { on: { '': [ { target: 'enabled', cond: 'isEnabled' }, { target: 'disabled' } ], }, }, enabled: { on: { DISABLE: 'disabled', }, }, disabled: { on: { ENABLE: 'enabled', }, }, }, }, activity: { initial: 'idle', states: { idle: { on: { SUBMIT: { target: 'busy', cond: 'isEnabled', }, }, }, busy: { entry: ['handleSubmit'], on: { SUCCESS: 'success', ERROR: 'error', }, }, success: { entry: ['handleSuccess'], on: { SUBMIT: { target: 'busy', cond: 'isEnabled', }, }, }, error: { entry: ['handleError'], on: { SUBMIT: { target: 'busy', cond: 'isEnabled', }, }, }, }, }, }, }, { actions: { handleSubmit() {}, handleSuccess() {}, handleError() {}, }, guards: { isEnabled(context) { return !context.disabled; }, }, } To decide in which state - disabled or enabled - we \"start\" out in when we first render the component we can make use of a transient transition. I.e. we will check the disabled property of the statechart's context and transition into disabled or enabled based on that property. You can play with the context-property on the statechart visualization to simulate a disabled-property that would be set from the outside in your Ember.js application. This is great! To refine this behavior we barely had to touch the existing statechart - we only extended existing behavior. We created a parallel state interactivity that implemenents behavior to make it possible to ENABLE or DISABLE the button. The parallel activity-state needs to take the interactivity into account when deciding if we want to transition into different substates when the statechart receives the SUBMIT-event but other than that we can be sure our component behaves the same way as it did before. Handling external changes - @disabled={{true}} We want to be able to disable the button via a param we pass to it: <QuickstartButton @onClick=this.doSomething @disabled={{disableButton}} > Click me! </QuickstartButton> In the context of statecharts we are modeling behavior based on states that continiously react to internal and external events. In our button component changing the disabled-argument can be treated as an external event because something outside of the component changed the disabled-parameter. This means we need to send an event to our button's statechart every time the disabled-argument changes. We can use the .update-hook that useMachine-provides to do that: export default class QuickstartButton extends Component { // ... @use statechart = useMachine(quickstartButtonRefinedMachine) .withContext({ disabled: this.args.disabled, }) .withConfig({ actions: { handleSubmit: this.performSubmitTask, handleSuccess: this.onSuccess, handleError: this.onError, }, guards: { isEnabled({ disabled }) { return !disabled; }, }, }) .update(({ send, context }) => { const { disabled } = context; if (disabled) { send('DISABLE'); } else { send('ENABLE'); } }); // ... } First we define the statechart's context object via withContext. In our case the statechart's context is a plain object with a disabled property that depends on the passed disabled argument. Whenever this property set from the outside changes useMachine will reevaluate and trigger its update-hook. In the update-hook we can send an event to the statechart based on the new context-object that withContext will evaluate to. So in our example we will send the DISABLE or ENABLE event based on what was passed for args.disabled. The update-hook will trigger every time a property passed to useMachine, withContext or withConfig changes. update will be passed an object with the following structure: send: Function - a function to send an event to the statechart restart: Function - a function to teardown the old and restart a new interpreter with the new configuration machine: The object passed to `useMachine` context: the object passed to `withContext` config: the object passed to `withConfig`As you can see we can either send an event to the statechart or decide to restart the entire statechart. In our case we decided to model the args-change explicitly and because we don't want to throw away the existing state of the statechart we opted not to use restart. How things look vs. how things behave Statecharts decouple behavior, i.e. the functionality of an Ember.Component from the way the component looks. This means that we might want to present the button as disabled not only in the disabled-state but also in other states of the statechart that don't allow submitting the button. We can use a regular getter to display the button correctly to our users: export default class QuickstartButton extends Component { // ... @matchesState({ activity: 'busy' }) isBusy; @matchesState({ interactivity: 'disabled' }) isDisabled; // we are not sure if the button is enabled or disabled because we have yet // to receive a `DISABLE` or `ENABLE` event @matchesState({ interactivity: 'unknown' }) isInteractivityUnknown; get showAsDisabled() { const { isDisabled, isBusy, isInteractivityUnknown } = this; return isDisabled || isBusy || isInteractivityUnknown; } // ... } Here's the final component that we came up with: Summary In this tutorial you learned how you can use statecharts to explicitly model behavior in your Ember.js applications. You have seen how you can make use of the statechart-editor to help you visualize what your components will be doing. We also walked through how you can make your statechart executable via the useMachine-usable and how you can use the matchesState-decorator to declaratively adapt the looks of your component based on state changes. The rest of the guides will go into more detail of how to work with statecharts in your Ember.js applications. Please also remember that everything that ember-statecharts is doing is backed by the great xstate-library. You can read about all the configuration options that xstate provides in the documentation of that project. This is a very valuable resource that you certainly want to use when you start using statecharts in your applications.","route":"docs.tutorial","keywords":[]},"template:index":{"id":"template:index","type":"template","title":null,"text":" Get started → ","route":"index","keywords":[]}}}
